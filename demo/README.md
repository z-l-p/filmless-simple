_These are demo files to try out the filmless-simple workflow:_

**Blank Frames**
  - 360 blank frames for generating template files (not usually needed)

**Skeleton Dance**
  - **Skeleton2.mp4** - a short source video derived from [Skeleton Dance (1929)](https://archive.org/details/the-skeleton-dance-1929-restored)
  - **frames** - 189 frames, exported from the source video
  
  - **audio** - 2 audio files, exported from the source video (The one marked "offset" is designed for looping. It has the 25 frame sound offset already applied, with the extra 25 frames wrapped to the beginning to make a seamless loop. (If you use this file, be sure to set the Processing variable SOUND_OFFSET to 0 instead of the usual 25.)
