# filmless-simple

# WARNING: Work in Progress

A simplified fork of the [filmless](https://github.com/sixteenmillimeter/filmless) toolkit for printing digital video onto projectable 16mm film strips. 

**filmless** is a complete package including Processing sketches, laser cutter templates, calibration functionality, and video conversion scripts. It can be adapted for many workflows, and uses entirely Free Software. 

**filmless-simple** is based on the Processing sketch from filmless, but optimized for one workflow: printing on clear 16mm leader that has been taped to letter-sized paper. filmless-simple assumes that you have access to an NLE (like Adobe Premiere) to prepare the image sequence and sound files. Once you set up Processing (see below) there aren't many choices to make. It generally "just works."

_filmless-simple was developed for a workshop at Cooper Union For the Advancement of Science and Art in March 2025, part of the [Cooper Handmade Cinema](https://handmadecinema.cooper.edu/) project, funded by the [CU Grant Program](https://cooper.edu/academics/research-fellowships/cooper-union-grant-program)._

## 1. Processing sketch for generating pages of film strips

This Processing sketch will create a printable page of 16mm-sized film strips from an image sequence, optionally containing a generated optical soundtrack. By including a path to a *mono* WAV audio file, this sketch will build an optical soundtrack facsimile using the [SoundtrackOptical](https://github.com/sixteenmillimeter/SoundtrackOptical) library for Processing and sit it in the correct area of the film strip.

The sketch can be modified to accommodate different desired output, **but you don't need to configure anything**. (The defaults are pre-set for printing onto letter-sized paper with sound.)  [Read more about setting the sketch variables.](#variables)

_Note: Processing can only read .tif files produced by the application itself, so unless you are using an image sequence generated by Processing, your input files should be .png or .jpeg._

## 2. Required Software

* An NLE to convert a video into image sequence + sound file (Premiere, Resolve, or Free Software Alternatives)
* A photo editor for viewing and printing the pages of "film" (PhotoShop, The GIMP, or even MacOS Preview)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - [[Download](https://processing.org/download/)]
* [Sound library for Processing](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html) - [[Download if not installed by default](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound)]
* [SoundtrackOptical library for Processing](https://github.com/sixteenmillimeter/SoundtrackOptical)

## 4. Processing variables

There are variables at the beginning of the Processing sketch that you can change. **They are pre-set to sensible defaults** so you don't need to change them.

```java
int DPI = 1440;
```

The DPI is the target for printing. The maximum DPI you'll be able to print is dependent on your printer or image reproduction technology. The higher the DPI, the higher the theoretical resolution of your output. This variable will also determine your sound quality, as you will only be able to reproduce the number of samples the vertical resolution allows. If your printer can only draw 10,000 lines in 24 frames, your sample rate will effectively be 10Khz.

```java
String SOUNDTRACK_TYPE = "unilateral";
```

The soundtrack type refers to the style of soundtrack that's produced by the sketch. The soundtrack is produced using [SoundtrackOptical](https://github.com/sixteenmillimeter/SoundtrackOptical) and the options are `unilateral`, `variable area`, `dual variable area`, `maurer`, `variable density`. Read more about these different types [here](http://www.paulivester.com/films/filmstock/guide.htm).

```java
String PITCH = "long";
```

The pitch of the film refers to the distance between the perforations. Long pitch films are generally projection films, while short pitch films are for cameras. If you plan on contact printing your generated film, you should change the variable to `short`.

```java
String FORMAT = "16mm";
```

`FORMAT` refers to the image format that your film strips will use. Either `16mm` for standard 16mm or `super16` for Super16.

Keep in mind: This sketch will scale your video frames to fit the size of the film frames. If you choose a standard 16mm format any frames provided to the script will be scaled to a ~4:3 aspect ratio. If you provide 1080P frames, they will be squashed from 16:9 to the square-ish 4:3 ratio. Conversely, if you choose the super16 format using `String FORMAT = "super16";` your 4:3 frames will be stretched to 1.66:1. 

Another thing to note: Super16 and soundtracks occupy the same space on the filmstrip and the script will throw an error if you try to include both audio and a Super16 image format.

```java
int PERFS = 1;
```

Refers to the number of perforations that will be printed as guides for your film. Can be either `1` or `2`. Similar to the conflict between Super16 and soundtracks, the second perforation on "double perf" film strips will occupy the same area that soundtracks and Super16 images do.

```java
float PAGE_W = 8.5;
float PAGE_H = 11.0;
float SAFE_W = .25;
float SAFE_H = 1.0;
```

Change these only when printing on larger format sheets than standard US letter stock. The "SAFE_" variables refer to the areas on both sides of the width or height of the sheet which will not be printed on. Changing these to higher values will reduce the maximum amount of frames that are able to be printed on a single sheet.

Using these default settings the script will generate 12 strips of 30 frames each, totally 360 frames per page.

```java
color BACKGROUND = color(255);
```
The color that will fill the entire frame where there's no image or soundtrack data. The `color()` method will accept grey values from `0` (black) to `255` (white) or will accept 8-bit RGB color values like `color(255, 0, 0)` (red), `color(0, 255, 0)` (green), `color(0, 0, 255)` (blue) or anything in between those values.

Note that the edges of film are under more pressure than the image area, so it's a good idea to avoid printing there. Setting the background to "clear" (255) keeps ink off of the edges where it will get abraded by friction.

```java
int GUIDELINE_PX = 16;
```

The pixel width of the vertical guidelines between strips of film (set to 0 to disable)

```java
int SHOW_PAGENUM = 0;
```

Set to 1 to print page numbers (leave it off for printing the template, to leave room for the page numbers to be overprinted later)

```java
boolean NEGATIVE = false;
```

Change this value from `false` to `true` to invert the colors of your images. Use this for contact printing or other experimental uses. Keep in mind: this will not perform the orange color mask inversion needed for color contact printing but will naively invert all color values.

```java
boolean SHOW_PERFS = true;
```

Set to `true` to print perfs for cutting registration. Set to `false` to print nothing.

```java
color PERFS_COLOR = color(255);
```

Set the color of the perforations, similar to `BACKGROUND`. By default, they will be drawn white.

```java
int SOUND_OFFSET = 25;
```

The sound offset is the number of frames before the image starts after the soundtrack starts. When set to `25` the image will start on the 26th frame, which is the standard for 16mm prints. Change this only if sync sound is not important.

To set the `MAGIC_W_CORRECTION` and `MAGIC_H_CORRECTION` variables, read the section on calibration in the original **filmless** repo.
